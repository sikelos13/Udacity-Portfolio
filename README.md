# Portfolio Project
This is a simple game built for the purpose of Udacity Nanodegree Program.

## Getting Started
This is a simple portfolio hosting my first 3 projects for Udacity Nanodegree Program.

## How I built the Portfolio
I worked on a pdf template given by Udacity.I made my HTML and CSS from scratch.
* created container and body using flexbox.
* created 3 queries to make portfolio responsive in mobile and tablet devices.
* created a logo using online webtools.
* added social media links using icons from fontawesome.
